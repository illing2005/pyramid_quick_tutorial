Pyramid is a web framework for Python 2 and 3. This tutorial gives a Python 3/2-compatible, high-level tour of the major features.

This hands-on tutorial covers "a little about a lot": practical introductions to the most common facilities. Fun, fast-paced, and most certainly not aimed at experts of the Pyramid web framework.
